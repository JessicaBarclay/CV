## Skills


#### Team player

Having worked closely with designers and marketing at Noble Studios, we created technically sound work ready for advertising and the web.
I am comfortable communicating with and approaching colleagues to seek advice or offer help, and have extensive experience in communicating with clients to achieve what they are looking for.


#### Takes responsibility

I can take responsibility for my own work, working well independently where necessary. Just months into my role as Junior Photographer for Noble Studios,
I successfully worked independently for Londonâ€™s most famous toy store over the Christmas period. This happened for two years consecutively,
having built up a good relationship with the client and exceeding their expectations.


#### Adobe Creative Suite CC

I am fully competent at a professional level in photographic retouching using Adobe Photoshop. This is from extensive experience supplying images ready for e-commerce websites, following client image specifications.
This involved creating and following InDesign documents, whilst communicating with design and web teams.


#### Fast learner

In my previous role as Photographer, I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines, thus meaning that I had to be focused and learn practical skills in a time conscious manner. I have put this ability into learning programming with Makers Academy, and have completely dedicated myself to taking on the challenge of a bootcamp style of learning, where I am fully emerged in programming every day.


#### Committed

I am extremely driven when exposed to an area I am interested in. For example whilst at University, I secured a job which started following my graduation in London's largest commercial photographic studio.
Learning to code is an enjoyable challenge, and I recognize that it is part of the role of a developer to continue learning day to day.
