## Skills


#### Team player

As Photographer at Noble Studios I created technically sound work for advertising and the web, working closely with designers and marketing teams.
I am comfortable communicating with colleagues to seek advice or offer help, and have extensive experience in communicating with clients to achieve what they are looking for, as I was expected to do this on a daily basis.


#### Technical ability

I have been involved in independent and group oriented programming projects, using Ruby, Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. Whilst implementing a challenging function in a Ruby project, course mates spoke of how my work was clean, and adaptable.
I have professional photographic retouching skills using Adobe Photoshop. This is from extensive experience supplying images ready for e-commerce websites in my previous role, following client image specifications.


#### Independent

I can take responsibility for my own work, working well independently where necessary. Just months into my role as Photographer for Noble Studios,
I successfully worked independently with Londonâ€™s most famous toy store, over the Christmas period. This happened for two years consecutively,
having built up a good relationship with the client and exceeding their expectations.


#### Fast learner

In my previous role as Photographer, I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines, thus meaning that I had to be focused and learn practical skills in a time conscious manner. I have put this ability into learning with Makers Academy, and have completely dedicated myself to taking on the challenge of a bootcamp style of learning, where I am fully emerged in programming every day.


#### Committed

Learning to code is an enjoyable challenge, and I recognize that it is part of the role of a developer to continue learning day to day. I am extremely driven particularly when exposed to an area I am interested in. For example whilst at University, I secured a job in London's largest commercial photographic studio which I started following my graduation.
