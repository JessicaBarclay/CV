A Software Developer in the making, with experience in a highly technical and creative role. A former Commercial Photographer, with a calibre of technical skills, and a natural problem solving ability with a creative flair.

Diving into the world of programming having committed to an intensive learning environment which is solely based on teaching best practises for the Software Development workplace.
Seeking employment as a front end junior developer, based on experience in a creative agency, across either London and the south, or in the Sheffield area.

## Skills

#### Adobe Creative Suite CC

I am fully competent at a professional level in photographic retouching using Adobe Photoshop, from extensive experience supplying images ready for e-commerce websites following image specifications.
This involved creating and following InDesign documents whilst communicating with design and web teams.


#### Team player

Having worked closely with designers and marketing as a team at Noble Studios, we created technically sound work ready for advertising and the web.
I am comfortable communicating with and approaching colleagues to seek advice or offer help, and have extensive experience in communicating with clients to achieve what they want.


#### Takes responsibility

I can take responsibility and work independently where necessary. Just months into my role as Junior Photographer for Noble Studios,
I worked independently for Londonâ€™s most famous toy store over the Christmas period. This happened for two years consecutively,
having built up a good relationship with the client and exceeding their expectations.


#### Fast learner

I thrive off learning new skills in an area I am interested in. I have completely dedicated myself to taking on the challenge of learning with Makers Academy,
where I am fully emerged in programming every day.


#### Strong interest in new technology

Since finding an interest in programming I began volunteering for MakerClub - a company which puts on programming and robotics workshops for children nationwide.
At MakerClub it is my responsibility to teach how to use micro-controllers similar to Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and teach basic coding to children ages 8-13.
