## Skills


#### Team player

As a Photographer at Noble Studios I created work for advertising and the web, working closely with designers and marketing teams.
It was a productive working environment as I am comfortable communicating with colleagues to seek advice or offer help.

On a daily basis I would discuss the details of briefs with clientele, explaining the technical aspects of the photography and addressing any ongoing changes.


#### Technical ability

I have been a team player in challenging programming projects with Makers Academy using Ruby, Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. Whilst implementing a challenging function in a Ruby project, course mates spoke of how my work was clean, and logical.

As a Commercial Photographer I had the responsibility of creating technically sound, creative work for advertising and e-commerce. I have professional retouching skills using Adobe Photoshop from my previous role, where I would supply images following client specifications.


#### Independent and takes responsibility

Just months into my role with Noble Studios, I was assigned to work independently for a new, highly regarded client. I had to learn new skills fast whilst I worked with London's most famous toy store. This happened during the Christmas period for two years consecutively, having built up a good relationship with the client and exceeding their expectations.


#### Fast learner

As a Commercial Photographer, I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines, thus meaning that I had to learn technical skills in a time conscious manner. I have put this ability into learning with Makers Academy, and have completely dedicated myself to taking on the challenge of a bootcamp style of learning, where I am fully emerged in programming every day.


#### Committed

Learning to code is an enjoyable challenge, and I recognize that it is part of the role of a developer to continue learning day to day. I am extremely driven particularly when exposed to an area I am interested in. This is evident in that whilst at University, I secured a job in London's largest commercial photographic studio which I started following my graduation.
