To whom this may concern,

I am a recent survivor of the highly selective programming bootcamp, Makers Academy. I would love to be introduced to the Engineering team in particular at the BBC, I have a skillset I think they will be really interested in. 

I am activeley seeking to expand my coding network particularly ones aimed at tackling the lack of diversity in this sector. Hacking for the day sounds like a wonderful way to meet like minded people!



**Tech Skills:** JavaScript, Ruby, Node.js, MVC frameworks, TDD, HTML, CSS, jQuery and SQL.

Please find my CV attached, and in the Github link below.



Look forward to hearing from you,

**Jessica Barclay**
