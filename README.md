  Full Stack Developer embarking on an intensive learning program with Makers Academy, being taught best practice for the software development workplace. Former Commercial Photographer boasting a strong technical ability, combined with a creative flair.

  Committed coder with an interest stemming from working with web teams in the workplace, and from building robots using micro-controllers! Approaches problem solving in a considered manner interested in writing clean, maintainable code.


## Skills


#### _Team work_

  I worked on several challenging team projects at Makers Academy. Whilst building a [Facebook clone](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Acebook) using Rails, team mates spoke of how my implementation of a 'Like' voting feature was clean, DRY and logical.

  I have written code in pairs and in teams of all sizes from 3 to 17. This has exposed me to learning key communicative skills, such as reviewing one another's code on Github and discussing.


#### _Fast learner_

  In my previous role as Photographer I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines, thus meaning that I had to learn technical skills in a time conscious manner.

I have put this ability into learning software development, for example - learning JavaScript in one week to build an [animated weather application](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Thermostat-Javascript), and a week later building my own vanilla JavaScript MVC.

#### _Communication_

  As a Photographer at [Noble Studios](https://www.noblestudios.co.uk/creative-product/) I created work for advertising and e-commerce, working closely with designers and marketing teams.
  Communication across teams was vital, and I enjoyed supporting and gaining knowledge from my co-workers.
