Full Stack Junior Developer and survivor of the selective programming bootcamp Makers Academy.

In my previous career, I translated User stories into Commercial Photography. I would communicate technical ideas to non-technical clientele, and to design and marketing teams.

I am interested in writing well crafted code, and satisfying my hunger for continuous learning. My commitment to a career in programming stems from working alongside web teams in the workplace in my previous role.

**Tech Skills:** JavaScript, Ruby, Node.js, React.js, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL, RESTful APIs.

## Skills

### Fast learner

* The single most important skill I was taught at Makers Academy, is learning how to learn.

  For example, with seven days experience of working with JavaScript I built my own vanilla JavaScript MVC and testing library.

* In my previous career as a Commercial Photographer, I would learn new technical skills every day, and apply them to live briefs. This ability has transferred into how I building upon my programming skill set.

### Research skills

- Whilst building a React Native iOS app, team mates spoke of how I have focused, researching skills and a methodical approach to mastering new skills, benefiting greatly to the whole team.

### Team Player

* During my time at Makers Academy I worked on several challenging collaborative projects. Whilst building a [Facebook clone](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Acebook) using Ruby on Rails, team mates spoke of how my implementation of a persistent 'Like' voting feature was clean, DRY and logical.

* My experience of coding in a team has been in an Agile environment. For example, when working in a team building a JavaScript type racer application, we would start every day by focussing on meeting our MVP, reviewing one another's code and continuously deploying new features.

### Communication

* Makers taught me key skills, such as reviewing my course mates work on Github. Feeding back and reflecting on one another's code was a really rewarding way to gain clarity on ones ability, and to understand others code.

* As a Photographer at Noble Studios I created work for advertising and e-commerce, working alongside designers and marketing teams. Communication across teams was vital, and I enjoyed supporting and gaining knowledge from my co-workers.
