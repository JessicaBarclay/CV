Full Stack Junior Developer and survivor of the selective programming bootcamp Makers Academy.
I have dedicated four months to focusing on problem solving capability, computational thinking and becoming a knowledge worker.<br><br>I am a committed coder with a creative flare whose interest in programming stems from working alongside web teams in the work place as a former Commercial Photographer.<br>

**Tech Skills:** JavaScript, Ruby, Node.js, Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap and SQL.
## Skills


### Knowledge worker

* The single most important skill I have taken away from Makers, is learning how to learn. <br><br>
* For example - building a test-driven application in JavaScript that utilises a weather API, and a week later building my own vanilla JavaScript MVC and testing library.

### Fast learner

* I have the capability to approach and begin building in new programming languages and MVC frameworks, by putting my knowledge of programming in other languages to work.

* I naturally absorb new technical skills in the workplace. In my previous role as a Commercial Photographer I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines, thus meaning that I had to learn technical skills in a time conscious manner.


### Team work

* During my time at Makers Academy I worked on several challenging team projects. Whilst building a [Facebook clone](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Acebook) using Rails, team mates spoke of how my implementation of a 'Like' voting feature was clean, DRY and logical.

* My experience of coding in a team has been in an Agile environment. For example, when working in a team building applications such as a type racer using vanilla JavaScript, we would stand-up every morning and discuss what we had learned from the previous day.

* At Makers we regularly reviewed one another's code and ended each day with a chance to feedback and reflect.

### Communication

* Makers exposed me to learning key communicative skills, such as reviewing one another's code on Github. Feeding back and reflecting on one another's code was a really rewarding way to gain clarity on ones ability, and to understand others code.

* As a Photographer at Noble Studios I created work for advertising and e-commerce, working alongside designers and marketing teams.
  Communication across teams was vital, and I enjoyed supporting and gaining knowledge from my co-workers.
