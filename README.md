Full Stack Junior Developer and survivor of the selective programming boot camp Makers Academy.

In my previous career, I translated User stories into Commercial Photography. I would communicate technical ideas to non-technical clientele, and to design and marketing teams.

I am interested in writing well-crafted code and satisfying my hunger for continuous learning. My commitment to a career in programming stems from working alongside web teams in the workplace in my previous role.

**Tech Skills:** JavaScript, Ruby, Node.js, React.js, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL, RESTful APIs.

## Skills

### Fast learner

* The single most important skill I was taught at Makers Academy, is learning how to learn.

  For example, in our final project at Makers, we successfully built a iOS and Android compatible app using React Native, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL - with no prior experience building mobile applications. 

* In my previous career as a Commercial Photographer, I would learn new technical skills every day and apply them to live briefs. Learning by doing allowed me to work with high profile clients in the early stages of my career.

### Research skills

- Whilst building a React Native mobile app, teammates spoke of how the majority of learning came from my how I personally applied my sound research skills to help combat the team with new skills fast.

### Team Player

* My experience of coding in a team has been in an Agile environment. For example, when working in a team building a JavaScript type racer application, we would start every day by focussing on meeting our MVP, reviewing one another's code and continuously deploying new features.

### Communication

* Makers taught me key skills, such as reviewing my course mates work on Github. Feeding back and reflecting on one another's code was a really rewarding way to gain clarity on one's ability, and to understand others code.
* As a Photographer at Noble Studios, I created work for advertising and e-commerce, working alongside designers and marketing teams. We would break down User Stories, allowing us to have a clear understanding of the problem we were solving.
