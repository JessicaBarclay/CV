Full Stack Junior Developer and survivor of the selective programming bootcamp that is [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).
I have dedicated four months to extending my problem solving capability, computational thinking and becoming a knowledge worker. I am a committed coder with a creative flare whose interest in programming stems from working alongside web teams in the work place as a former Commercial Photographer.

**Tech Skills**: JavaScript, Ruby, Node.js, Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap and SQL database engines.


## Skills


#### _Knowledge worker_

The single most important skill I have taken away from Makers, learning how to learn. For example - learning JavaScript in one week to build a [test-driven application](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Thermostat-Javascript) that utilises a weather API , and a week later building my own vanilla JavaScript MVC and testing library.

#### _Fast learner_

I have the capability to approach and begin building in new programming languages, frameworks and testing frameworks, by putting my knowledge from other languages to work.

I naturally absorb new technical skills in the workplace. In my previous role as Photographer I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines, thus meaning that I had to learn technical skills in a time conscious manner.


#### _Team work_

During my time at Makers Academy I worked on several challenging team projects. Whilst building a [Facebook clone](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Acebook) using Rails, team mates spoke of how my implementation of a 'Like' voting feature was clean, DRY and logical.

My experience of coding in a team has been in an Agile environment. For example, when working in a team building applications such as type racer a using vanilla JavaScript, we would stand-up every morning and discuss what we had learned from the previous day. We regularly reviewed one another's code and ended each day with a chance the feedback and reflect.

#### _Communication_

Makers exposed me to learning key communicative skills, such as reviewing one another's code on Github. My coach spoke of how our cohort was thorough or showed a real interest in receiving feedback to improve upon our work.

As a Photographer at Noble Studios I created work for advertising and e-commerce, working alongside designers and marketing teams.
Communication across teams was vital, and I enjoyed supporting and gaining knowledge from my co-workers.
