Full Stack Junior Developer and survivor of the selective programming bootcamp Makers Academy.

In my previous career, I translated User stories into Commercial Photography. I would communicate technical ideas in a non-technical manner, to clientele, and to design and marketing teams.<br><br>

I have dedicated six months to focusing on my problem solving capability and creating well crafted code. My commitment to a career in programming stems from working alongside web teams in the workplace in my previous role.

**Tech Skills:** JavaScript, Ruby, Node.js, React.js, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, SQL.

## Skills

### Fast learner

* The single most important skill I was taught at Makers Academy, is learning how to learn.<br>

  For example, building a test-driven application in JavaScript that utilises a weather API. A week later, building on this knowledge, I constructed my own vanilla JavaScript MVC and testing library.

* In my previous career as a Commercial Photographer, I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines. I had to learn new technical skills every day, in a time conscious manner.

### Research skills

- Whilst building a React Native iOS app as our final project, team mates spoke of how I have focused, researching skills and a methodical approach to mastering new skills, benfeting greatly to the whole team.

### Team Player

* During my time at Makers Academy I worked on several challenging team projects. Whilst building a [Facebook clone](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Acebook) using Ruby on Rails, team mates spoke of how my implementation of a persistant 'Like' voting feature was clean, DRY and logical.
* My experience of coding in a team has been in an Agile environment. For example, when working in a team building a JavaScript type racer application, we would start every day by focussing on meeting our MVP, reviewing one another's code and continuously deploying new features.

### Communication

* Makers taught me key skills, such as reviewing my course mates work on Github. Feeding back and reflecting on one another's code was a really rewarding way to gain clarity on ones ability, and to understand others code.

* As a Photographer at Noble Studios I created work for advertising and e-commerce, working alongside designers and marketing teams. Communication across teams was vital, and I enjoyed supporting and gaining knowledge from my co-workers.
