  I am a Full Stack Developer in the making specializing in Ruby and Javascript. I'm currently embarking on an intensive learning program with Makers Academy which teaches best practice for the software development workplace.

  I am a former Commercial Photographer boasting an impressive calibre of technical skills, and a methodical approach to problem solving combined with a creative flair. My interest in programming stemmed from working with web development teams in the workplace, as well as participating in voluntary work at a programming and robotics club for children.

  Equipped with a strong transferable skill set, paired with a keen interest in the software development - I am currently pursuing a career in the world of programming.


## Skills


#### Team work

  As a Photographer at [Noble Studios](https://www.noblestudios.co.uk/creative-product/) I created work for advertising, e-commerce and the web, working closely with designers and marketing teams.
  It was a productive working environment where communication was a key value expected from every team member.


  I have worked on several team projects at Makers Academy. Whilst building a [Facebook clone](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Acebook) using Rails, team mates spoke of how my implementation of a 'Like' voting feature was clean, Dry and logical.


#### Fast learner

  As a Commercial Photographer, I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines, thus meaning that I had to learn technical skills in a time conscious manner. I have put this ability into learning with Makers Academy, for example - learning JavaScript in one week to build an [animated weather application](https://github.com/JessicaBarclay/Thermostat-Javascript).
