  I am a Full Stack Developer in the making specializing in Ruby and Javascript. Currently embarking on an intensive learning program with Makers Academy which teaches best practice for the software development workplace. Seeking employment as a full stack developer across London and the south.

  A former Commercial Photographer boasting an impressive calibre of technical skills, and a methodical approach to problem solving combined with a creative flair. My interest in programming stemmed from working with web development teams in the workplace, as well as participating in voluntary work at a programming and robotics club for children.

  Having a strong transferable skill set, paired with a keen interest in the programming - I am currently pursuing a career in the world of programming.


## Skills


#### Team player

  As a Photographer at Noble Studios I created work for advertising, e-commerce and the web, working closely with designers and marketing teams.
  It was a productive working environment where communication was a key value expected from every team member. I would discuss the details of creative briefs with clientele, explaining the technical aspects of the photography and addressing any ongoing changes.


#### Technical ability

  I have been a team player in challenging programming projects with Makers Academy using Ruby, Javascript, Rails and other MVC frameworks. Whilst implementing a challenging function in a Ruby project, course mates spoke of how my work was clean, DRY and logical.

  As a Commercial Photographer I had the responsibility of creating technically sound, creative work for advertising and e-commerce. I have professional retouching skills using Adobe Photoshop from my previous role, where I would supply images following client specifications.


#### Independent and takes responsibility

  Just months into my role with Noble Studios, I was assigned to work independently for a new, highly regarded client. I had to learn new skills fast whilst I worked with London's most famous toy store. This happened during the Christmas period for two years consecutively, having built up a good relationship with the client and exceeding their expectations.


#### Fast learner

  As a Commercial Photographer, I was expected to work at an efficient pace to meet tight deadlines, thus meaning that I had to learn technical skills in a time conscious manner. I have put this ability into learning with Makers Academy, and have completely dedicated myself to taking on the challenge of a bootcamp style of learning, where I am fully emerged in programming every day.


#### Committed

  Learning to code is an enjoyable challenge, and I recognize that it is part of the role of a developer to continue learning day to day. I am extremely driven particularly when exposed to an area I am interested in. This is evident in that whilst at University, I secured a job in London's largest commercial photographic studio which I started following my graduation.
